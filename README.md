I'm learnin C through [Programiz.pro](https://programiz.pro/), soon gonna build a chess engine with an end of game "evaluation" similar to chess.com (Maybe in C, will be a general purpose comipled programming language though)

However for now this does what it says on the tin. Nothing special, static varaibles, not dynamic in the slightest :) (will get there though)
